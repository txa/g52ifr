(** * Why using a proof assistant?

   - Avoid holes in paper proofs.
   
   - Aid understanding. What is a proof?

   - Formal certification of software and hardware.

*)

(** * Using COQ
  
  - Download COQ from http://coq.inria.fr/

  - Runs under MacOS, Windows, Linux

  - coqtop : command line interface

  - coqide : graphical user interface

  - proof general : emacs interface

  - coqtop and coqide installed on the lab machines
